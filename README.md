# Cell Engineering Game

Welcome to the **Cell Engineering Game**! This is an interactive browser-based game where you can learn about cell engineering by guiding a ball through different cell type landing zones using transcription factors.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. **Objective**: Use transcription factors (TFs) to guide the ball into the landing zones to create different cell types.
2. **Budget**: Start with a $3000 budget. Each failed experiment (when the ball falls below the screen) costs $1000.
3. **Winning**: Successfully guide the ball into all the landing zones.
4. **Losing**: If your budget reaches $0, the game ends.

### Controls
- Click on the TF buttons to toggle transcription factors on or off. Each combination affects the ball's trajectory differently.

### Key Features
- **Landing Page**: Start with a welcoming screen with instructions and a "Start Game" button.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Use transcription factors to influence the ball's movement.
- **Budget System**: Manage your budget effectively to avoid losing the game.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Messages for success, failure, and game status.
